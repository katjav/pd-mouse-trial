# pd-mouse-trial

mousepad: mouse tracking widget for Pure Data.
Unstable API, do not use in your projects.

As the repo name tells this project is of explorative nature. It is published here to illustrate one of many mouse tracking possibilities under discussion on pd-dev list. If the discussion leads to a different approach, this mousepad project will abandoned. Otherwise the API _will_ change. Use 'mousepad' only to investigate.
